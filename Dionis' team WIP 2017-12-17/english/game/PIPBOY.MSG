# Vault 8: Investigator report
# GVAR_HOLODISK_COUNTRY_MSG (GVAR_HOLODISK_MB_OUTSIDE)
{2000}{}{A draft of a report about a criminal prosecution}
{2001}{}{}
{2002}{}{Author Malcolm Rivers, deputy Sheriff}
{2003}{}{}
{2004}{}{}
{2005}{}{I wrote this report incase, if something}
{2006}{}{happens to us. If you find this}
{2007}{}{notes, send them to Washoe County Sheriff,}
{2008}{}{state of Nevada.}
{2009}{}{}
{2010}{}{Entry 1}
{2011}{}{}
{2012}{}{Ely Gorbinsky - that damn son of a bitch. he escaped}
{2013}{}{justice after killing an Afro-American}
{2014}{}{in Reno. The court released him on a}
{2015}{}{house arrest. I can't leave such a bold act}
{2016}{}{of racism! That’s why I started to collect information}
{2017}{}{about the criminal, and I was right. He actually left}
{2018}{}{the town in north direction ignoring,}
{2019}{}{the court's order. When he felt he's been watched,}
{2020}{}{Gorbinsky tried to disappear, but I constantly followed}
{2021}{}{him, until the events on the road.}
{2022}{}{Few miles away from NPP "Poseidon Oil"}
{2023}{}{I cached up to him, the criminal tried to ram}
{2024}{}{my car off the road. There was an accident, both}
{2025}{}{vehicles where destroyed. Gorbinsky took a hit}
{2026}{}{in the head and lost consciousness, I got away}
{2027}{}{with few bruises (luckily!). While the bastart was,}
{2028}{}{regaining his senses I called for backup on the radio.}
{2029}{}{}
{2030}{}{The truck from NPP arrived, he took us to the}
{2031}{}{station. In order to prevent Gorbinsky}
{2032}{}{from trying anything, I handcuffed him}
{2033}{}{and confiscated all his belongings. On the station}
{2034}{}{we could not get help, there was a mess. It seemed,}
{2035}{}{that NPP was packing the equipment, and people}
{2036}{}{where preparing for an evac. But I had no time to}
{2037}{}{learn anything. My backup never arrived.}
{2038}{}{We had to take the bus in the morning}
{2039}{}{going to Reno. The driver made a stop}
{2040}{}{ at a mining village of the Wilsons}
{2041}{}{family property. They are decent folks,}
{2042}{}{that are mining in the area, they accepted}
{2043}{}{us very well.}
{2044}{}{}
{2045}{}{Sometime around 12:30 ïî Ely Gorbinsky}
{2046}{}{escaped from me. While he was handcuffed}
{2047}{}{to a radiator, I went to a store,}
{2048}{}{he picked the lock with a piece of wire.}
{2049}{}{When I run out of the house, he already}
{2050}{}{high jacked a bus and was driving full speed}
{2051}{}{south. He had passengers with him, that}
{2052}{}{probably didn't even notice. The bus driver}
{2053}{}{was found dead in the restroom.}
{2054}{}{}
{2055}{}{There is no radio here, the next bus will come}
{2056}{}{tomorrow noon. Local truck is under repair,}
{2057}{}{and it will be finished only tomorrow morning.}
{2058}{}{The only thing that left is to hope, that}
{2059}{}{in that time Gorbinsky won't make any more trouble.}
{2060}{}{}
{2061}{}{But, either way, I will make him pay!}
{2062}{}{Criminals can't walk on the freedom.}
{2063}{}{Even in this remote place, that is our county.}
{2064}{}{}
{2065}{}{Entry 2}
{2066}{}{}
{2067}{}{I waited for a bus until 16:00. When I realized, that}
{2068}{}{it won't come, I started convincing the mechanic,}
{2069}{}{that he should hurry up with the truck. But he}
{2070}{}{was drunk. I'm forced again to stay here for another}
{2071}{}{day, while that damned Gorbinsky is loose}
{2072}{}{and has a stolen vehicle! This is going to be}
{2073}{}{tough to wait, I must stop him, but instead}
{2074}{}{I sit here, bound by some mechanical problems.}
{2075}{}{Am I the only one, that cares about justice}
{2076}{}{in this place?..}
{2077}{}{}
{2078}{}{We wrapped up driver's body in a sheet of clothing}
{2079}{}{and placed him in the hangar. Bastard!}
{2080}{}{When I get to Gorbinsky, no judge is going}
{2081}{}{to save him!}
{2082}{}{}
{2083}{}{Entry 3}
{2084}{}{}
{2085}{}{It was a rough day today...}
{2086}{}{}
{2087}{}{The bus didn't showed up again. later that}
{2088}{}{day I just forced the mechanic to repair the engine}
{2089}{}{in the truck. We went to Reno next,}
{2090}{}{but on our way, in the next valley, we spotted the}
{2091}{}{bus, on which Gorbinsky escaped.}
{2092}{}{It was empty. And for some reason in was facing the village.}
{2093}{}{Gorbinsky came back, or he didn't left at all!}
{2094}{}{I tried to reach my people on the radio of the bus,}
{2095}{}{or at least the bus station in Reno,}
{2096}{}{I received some white noise instead of an answer.}
{2097}{}{Did everybody, just died in there, God damn it?!}
{2098}{}{}
{2099}{}{We returned to the village, in order to warn}
{2100}{}{the people about the danger, but it was late - one}
{2101}{}{of the workers died by a forced death in the diner.}
{2102}{}{You wouldn't wish this on your enemy.}
{2103}{}{}
{2104}{}{I stayed, in order to help the locals.}
{2105}{}{Otherwise what kind of fucking deputy Sheriff I am, hah?}
{2106}{}{In this place I especially miss Fimida, the woman}
{2107}{}{I missed so much since I came to America...}
{2108}{}{I was right to stay.}
{2109}{}{Late at night Wilsons found another worker's head}
{2110}{}{in the washing machine.}
{2111}{}{}
{2112}{}{That son of a bitch is somewhere close!}
{2113}{}{I just have to stop him, before anyone else}
{2114}{}{gets hurt...}
{2115}{}{}
{2116}{}{Entry 4}
{2117}{}{}
{2118}{}{... I couldn’t sleep. The truck was set on fire at night.}
{2119}{}{The mechanic was inside. He was last seen drunk, Wilsons}
{2120}{}{decided, that he was the one to set the truck on fire.}
{2121}{}{But I know, who've done this!}
{2122}{}{}
{2123}{}{Now we have no transport. At all.}
{2124}{}{Those that interfered with my investigation, where locked away}
{2125}{}{in the diner. Let them sit, while I find that}
{2126}{}{filthy scum...}
{2127}{}{}
{2128}{}{Entry 5}
{2129}{}{}
{2130}{}{I'm all alone now.}
{2131}{}{All this time I was making notes Gorbinsky}
{2132}{}{killed one person at a time...}
{2133}{}{Bastard! I hope you'll burn in hell!!! ...}
{2134}{}{Nobody except me, can stop him now}
{2135}{}{and restore justice.}
{2136}{}{Only if... ONLY IF that judge condemned him on}
{2137}{}{an electric chair...}
{2138}{}{ONLY IF the patrol would respond}
{2139}{}{in time...}
{2140}{}{What is happening in the world, damn it?!}
{2141}{}{Why nobody's looking for us?}
{2142}{}{Why there is still no bus?}
{2143}{}{Could it be that a war started?..}
{2144}{}{}
{2145}{}{I'm going to stop the bastard *by any means necessary*.}
{2146}{}{And let them fire me, I won't leave it}
{2147}{}{like this.}

# Hawthorne: Report on deserters
# GVAR_HOWTHORNE_DSK_DESERTIRES (GVAR_HOLODISK_MB_LEVEL_3)
{5000}{}{}
{5001}{}{This document contains a case report}
{5002}{}{of mass desertion.}
{5003}{}{}
{5004}{}{As the commission established, a group of soldiers}
{5005}{}{seized equipment and weapons from Hawthorn warehouses,}
{5006}{}{after that fought their way out of the perimeter}
{5007}{}{of the base. The reason that pushed the soldiers to}
{5008}{}{commit a crime, was panic, supposedly caused by}
{5009}{}{declassified information about the upcoming nuclear}
{5010}{}{war.}
{5011}{}{}
{5012}{}{Deserters took their families and personal belongings}
{5013}{}{with them. It is established that the group took}
{5014}{}{shelter in the vault code-named "Wind of War".}
{5015}{}{This test shelter is located near the city}
{5016}{}{Paramp. It was intended for testing of building}
{5017}{}{materials, used in the project network}
{5018}{}{of vaults Vault-Tec, After which it was transferred}
{5019}{}{to the military base department for educational purposes.}
{5020}{}{Coordinates to the vault are included.}
{5021}{}{}
{5022}{}{The report is dated October 22, 2077.}

# Gov. vault: Entries from Stepleton's diary
# GVAR_HOLODISK_ENCLAV_DIARY (GVAR_HOLODISK_SIERRA_EXP_LOG)
{7000}{}{Records from Mr. Stepleton's diary}
{7001}{}{}
{7002}{}{(Records were conducted with variable regularity}
{7003}{}{for several years in the govermental vault. You}
{7004}{}{wrote down only the most interesting fragments.)}
{7005}{}{}
{7006}{}{**END-PAR**}
{7007}{}{July 9, 2077}
{7008}{}{The vault is sealed. People have mixed feelings.}
{7009}{}{Some are clearly inclined to claustrophobia, seizures}
{7010}{}{and are running around in the corridor. Our doctor}
{7011}{}{is constantly overwhelmed with work with such}
{7012}{}{idiots. The vice president after a mental breakdown}
{7013}{}{left the dining room in wet pants and for a long}
{7014}{}{time tried to convince everyone that it was spilled}
{7015}{}{nuka-cola. By the way, it began to eat away the}
{7016}{}{jumpsuit. I wonder what the cola is made of?}
{7017}{}{}
{7018}{}{July 15, 2077}
{7019}{}{Things gradually calmed down. The President ordered}
{7020}{}{to include the creek noise in the center of the lawn}
{7021}{}{opposite dining room. Now it's nice and peaceful there.}
{7022}{}{}
{7023}{}{August 10, 2077}
{7024}{}{All are well accustomed to their rooms and do not}
{7025}{}{want to get out. No one cares about anything, looking}
{7026}{}{only after themselves. With the exception of our}
{7027}{}{guards, these poor guys have to do exercises every}
{7028}{}{day in the gym. They say Private McKinley refused to}
{7029}{}{get out of bed for the training and for this the}
{7030}{}{sergeant cut his share of Nuka-Cola. Very cruel}
{7031}{}{punishment.}
{7032}{}{}
{7033}{}{September 10, 2077}
{7034}{}{Nuka-Cola is causing, people to burp and colors their}
{7035}{}{tongues red, but no one is even remotely worried}
{7036}{}{about it, because everyone likes it. A competition}
{7037}{}{began for the loudest burp possible. Private McKinley}
{7038}{}{is currently in the lead.}
{7039}{}{}
{7040}{}{September 12, 2077. Although the private McKinley}
{7041}{}{is a bit behind in the competition, everyone says}
{7042}{}{that his burp, if not the loudest, is the most}
{7043}{}{resounding. A team of musicians is recruited from}
{7044}{}{the population who will play and sing using only}
{7045}{}{burp of a very different frequency. I think I'll}
{7046}{}{do well for the task.}
{7047}{}{}
{7048}{}{September 18, 2077. Damn it! Today we made a general}
{7049}{}{warning that the concerts of burpists are henceforth}
{7050}{}{forbidden, since at such rates of consumption of Nuka-}
{7051}{}{Cola it simply won’t be any left in the vault. It's a}
{7052}{}{pity. After all, the first concerts of burpsinging were}
{7053}{}{successful. How can we be now without their unforgettable}
{7054}{}{compositions...}
{7055}{}{}
{7056}{}{September 20, 2077. Private McKinley came up with a}
{7057}{}{new competition! Spitting for a long distance! Damn,}
{7058}{}{this is a great idea! I hope, at least this is not}
{7059}{}{forbidden to us!}
{7060}{}{}
{7061}{}{September 21, 2077.}
{7062}{}{Private McKinley became a victim of his own idea.}
{7063}{}{When trying to spit the cap of a pen, the}
{7064}{}{cap fell into the trachea of the private, and}
{7065}{}{he choked. The doctor says that the case is unique,}
{7066}{}{and it never happened in his practice. The doctor}
{7067}{}{refused to pull out the cap. Poor cap... That is,}
{7068}{}{poor private.}
{7069}{}{}
{7070}{}{September 27, 2077. Without the private McKinley, it}
{7071}{}{became boring. Therefore, the superintendent ordered}
{7072}{}{to arrange parties in the dining room on Saturdays.}
{7073}{}{Cool. I hope they will give us Nuka-Cola.}
{7074}{}{}
{7075}{}{September 30, 2077. At the party, the sergeant had}
{7076}{}{too much cola and beat the vice president. The reason}
{7077}{}{was a dispute about whose burp was cooler - the vice}
{7078}{}{president said that his was more sonorous, and the}
{7079}{}{sergeant claimed that his burp worked best. A fight}
{7080}{}{broke out.}
{7081}{}{}
{7082}{}{Sep. 31, 2077. The sergeant and vice-president sat in}
{7083}{}{the dining room at the table, like old friends.}
{7084}{}{Probably, that’s how it is.}
{7085}{}{**END-PAR**}
{7086}{}{*********}
{7087}{}{}
{7088}{}{Aug. 5, 2078. There are rumors in the vault that the}
{7089}{}{war did not happen. Of course, ordinary people are}
{7090}{}{not allowed to know this, but if so, all this time we}
{7091}{}{were doing nothing, when outside the world lived as}
{7092}{}{before? We need to convene a council, so that the}
{7093}{}{overseer explain the whole situation to us.}
{7094}{}{}
{7095}{}{August 13, 2078. The overseer suddenly announced that}
{7096}{}{the cola synthesizer in the vault was broken, and now}
{7097}{}{we are left without our favorite entertainment. The}
{7098}{}{people are in panic.}
{7099}{}{}
{7100}{}{August 15, 2078. People were tired of waiting, and}
{7101}{}{everyone began to write a petition to the president,}
{7102}{}{so that the cola synthesizer would be quickly fixed.}
{7103}{}{}
{7104}{}{August 20, 2078. Out of nothing to do, residents}
{7105}{}{began to write petitions addressed to the president.}
{7106}{}{I also wrote that I want the walls painted in blue,}
{7107}{}{and the neighbor asked for a rope and a piece of soap.}
{7108}{}{I wonder why he needs them?}
{7109}{}{}
{7110}{}{August 27, 2078.}
{7111}{}{Fuck! Why did my neighbor's request was complete, but}
{7112}{}{my not? I am disappointed! What do these damn}
{7113}{}{bureaucrats do in the government office! Maybe I}
{7114}{}{should write a petition again?}
{7115}{}{}
{7116}{}{**END-PAR**}
{7117}{}{}
{7118}{}{*********}
{7119}{}{}
{7120}{}{February 5, 2086. The situation is just crap! The}
{7121}{}{vault was divided into two camps. Some defend the}
{7122}{}{sergeant with his policy of "staying in place," while}
{7123}{}{others support the vice president, who calls everyone}
{7124}{}{to leave the shelter to help those in need after the}
{7125}{}{war in the outside world. I do not think it's worth}
{7126}{}{sharing our technology with all sorts of radioactive}
{7127}{}{zombies. So far, only the overseer and the president}
{7128}{}{himself remain on the sidelines and are silent about}
{7129}{}{their opinion.}
{7130}{}{}
{7131}{}{March 12, 2086. The fights became so intense that}
{7132}{}{they will soon split the dining room in two!}
{7133}{}{}
{7134}{}{March 13, 2086. Its over. This is the end. Today}
{7135}{}{after a massive drinking of cola a whole battle}
{7136}{}{between factions broke out they fought hand to hand}
{7137}{}{and even with chairs. Why are people so mad? Maybe}
{7138}{}{they add something in it that increases aggression?}
{7139}{}{}
{7140}{}{March 14, 2086. Those fucking gangs! They got drunk}
{7141}{}{again and had a fight! The sergeant drove a chair}
{7142}{}{over the head to the president himself!}
{7143}{}{And it fell off.}
{7144}{}{What will happen now!?}
{7145}{}{}
{7146}{}{March 15, 2086. The factions concluded a temporary}
{7147}{}{truce to solve the problem of the absence of the}
{7148}{}{president. More precisely, this problem is now}
{7149}{}{solved by the overseer and the doctor. They decided}
{7150}{}{to connect the severed head to the wires and try to}
{7151}{}{revive it. Why the hell we need it anyway, but the}

{7154}{}{March 20, 2086. Who would have thought ?! Today,}
{7155}{}{the solemn launch of the head of the President took}
{7156}{}{place. The first words that the head said when}
{7157}{}{switching on the toggle switches were: "Assholes,}
{7158}{}{where is my doll?!" The doll was found in the}
{7159}{}{president's office, and after that the head calmed}

{7164}{}{It turned out that it had been subjugating computer}

{7166}{}{coming from the loudspeaker, and the donut machine}
{7167}{}{began to bake donuts in the form of a hanging loop.}

{7174}{}{}
{7175}{}{July 4, 2087. The Council did not reach a single}
{7176}{}{conclusion. It turned out that we can not}
{7177}{}{disconnect the head. The head was already so} 
{7178}{}{strongly implanted in the vault network that it}
{7179}{}{began to control even the power supply. Story}

{7182}{}{Jan 10, 2090. In recent years we have been sitting}

{7184}{}{by direct threats. The head complains that we dont}
{7185}{}{listen and dont take care of it, never scratch its} 
{7186}{}{feet and etc. It became dangerous. The head is in a}
{7187}{}{state of mental breakdown, like all of us. They say} 
{7188}{}{it even controls the security turrets. Is it true?}

{8012}{}{is not provided, it chooses more and more stringent}

{9004}{}{ }
{9005}{}{The general point is that the vault was created for}

{9007}{}{the president, his family and his staff. It was was}
{9008}{}{equipped with the latest technology, but this did}

{9010}{}{the misfortune happened with the president - his}
{9011}{}{head was torn off. The head was revived in the}
{9012}{}{laboratory, so as not to lose the secret knowledge}
{9013}{}{of the President. However, the head was too self-}
{9014}{}{centered, and after losing attention to one's own}
{9015}{}{person, it began to behave despotically. The banter}
{9016}{}{over citizens was replaced by a clear threat to}
{9017}{}{their life or health. The recommendation to destroy}
{9018}{}{the head was belated - the head managed to}
{9019}{}{subordinate computer systems and various robotics.}
{9020}{}{Any oversight could become critical for residents.}
{9021}{}{As a result, it was decided to leave the shelter}
{9022}{}{and relocate to a reserve government base in an oil}
{9023}{}{rig in the ocean. However, on the day of exodus,}
{9024}{}{the head tried to stop the fugitives.}
{9025}{}{ }
{9026}{}{A group of guards decided to destroy the reservoir}
{9027}{}{with the head, but when they got to the lab,}
{9028}{}{turrets where activated, and as a result they were}
{9029}{}{killed. After that, the head began to exterminate}
{9030}{}{everyone it could. Yet most of the citizens were}
{9031}{}{saved, including the current president. They took}
{9032}{}{the most valuable equipment and escaped.}

{19009}{}{}
{19010}{}{Today Emily confessed that she took a flower from}
{19011}{}{our neighbor's garden. All our family, together,}
{19012}{}{apologized to this worthy man, Mr. Flowers, he}
{19013}{}{favorably accepted our apologies. And now, as I'm}
{19014}{}{writing this, Emily prays to seek forgiveness from}
{19015}{}{Our Lord. She does this voluntarily, as the seed of}
{19016}{}{faith gave sprouts in her innocent soul, and this}
{19017}{}{delights me ceaselessly...}
{19018}{}{But back to the point! My parish awaits its pastor,}

{19024}{}{Bitter news came to our town - Mrs. Schultz's son,}
{19025}{}{major Otto Schultz, perished in the Jilin}

{19044}{}{horizon, expanding rapidly, greedily consuming}
{19045}{}{souls of the Lambs of God...}

{19066}{}{Glory to Our Lord! I was so blind... I was}

{19068}{}{and revelation came upon me! All that happened is}
{19069}{}{part of the Greater Plan of Our Maker - to ascend}
{19070}{}{the suffering souls up to Heaven! The flash that}
{19071}{}{nearly blinded me - was the light of Pearly Gates}

{19073}{}{into this purgatory by the servants of satan,}
{19074}{}{tempting us with false promises of safety, in}
{19075}{}{defiance of Our Father's will... Mary, I know}

{19085}{}{upon this condemned place. Satan's beast disguised}
{19086}{}{as Mr. Flowers tried to stop me, but fire axe in my}
{19087}{}{hands like a blazing sword of Archangel, hacked}
{19088}{}{squealing satan's envoy to pieces. Oh yes, many of}
{19089}{}{them died at my hand that day... There is no food}
{19090}{}{left, but through the power of Our Lord I communed}
{19091}{}{with their flesh and blood, and it was better than}
{19092}{}{any wine... But Mary, what's most important, our}
{19093}{}{child will soon join you! For some reason, she}

{19169}{}{one, on a picture of a sinful damsel (not that}

{19172}{}{you. Therefore, if I will not return safely, my}
